1. How do I approach designing software?
  - What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    I have not had any prior experience working on graphics. Learning how to break down a scene and placing objects, camera angles, and light sources to accurately recreate the scene I chose.
    
  - What design process did you follow for your project work?
      I like to break down software into small chunks to knock out on at a time. I like to work on one feature and try to hammer that out as completely as possible. Breaking down and creating the objects first, then adding proper shaders and textures
    
  - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
      Starting small and building up bigger I chose to kind of start by creating the objects then adding all of the shaders, textures or lights.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
  - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
      I used OpenGL which was entirely new for me. I have never used an api that allows me to utilize the gpu for t
    
  - How did iteration factor into your development?
      iteration was huge, I started with the base object and I would start by creating the object, placing it, shading it, and then having to do that with each both simple object and complex objects. It took many iterations to ensure everything ended up looking right and being in the correct spot
    
  - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
      At first I was playing around with the code I was given trying to figure out how it worked changing a variable her and there in order to see what it did and obviously I broke a few things and had to figure out where I had gone wrong. I was testing and building my scene every 30 seconds, as I learned OpenGL and got more comfortable I could make more objects and place them as well as shade them many at once before rebuilding the project. 



3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  -How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
     Working with OpenGL I learned about pipeline-like projects where you have many steps in the flow of the data.
