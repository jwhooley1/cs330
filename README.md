For my project I decide to recreate my living room table on any given day. I tend to toss a spattering of different belongings there throughout the day. I grabbed a few different objects I had laying around in order to introduce more shapes and colors into my scene to make sure that I had different complex shapes.
I set my program up to move directionally by using W to move forward, A to move to the left, S to move backwards, D to move to the right, Q moves upward and E moves downward. In order to change the speed of movement the user can use the scroll wheel and to changing the position of the mouse changes the camera angle appropriately.
